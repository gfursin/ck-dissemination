<b>Abstract</b>

Nowadays, engineers have to develop software often without even
knowing which hardware it will eventually run on in numerous
mobile phones, tablets, desktops, laptops, data centers,
supercomputers and cloud services.

Unfortunately, optimizing compilers are not keeping pace with
ever increasing complexity of ever changing computer systems
anymore and may produce severely underperforming executable codes
while wasting expensive resources and energy.

We present the first to our knowledge practical, collaborative
and publicly available solution to this problem.

We help the software engineering community gradually implement 
and share light-weight wrappers around any software piece with 
more than one implementation or optimization choice available.

These wrappers are connected with a public <a href="http://c-mind.org">&nbsp;<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;
Collective Mind autotuning infrastructure and repository of knowledge</a>
to continuously monitor all important characteristics of these pieces
(<i>computational species</i>) across numerous existing hardware
configurations in realistic environments together with randomly
selected optimizations.

At the same time, <a href="http://c-mind.org/cmn">Collective Mind Node</a>
allows to easily crowdsource time-consuming autotuning across
existing Android-based mobile device including commodity
mobile phones and tables.

Similar to natural sciences, we can now continuously track all
winning solutions (optimizations for a given hardware such
as compiler flags, OpenCL/CUDA/OpenMP/MPI/skeleton parameters,
number of threads and any other exposed by users) that minimize
all costs of a computation (execution time, energy spent, code
size, failures, memory and storage footprint, optimization time,
faults, contentions, inaccuracy and so on) of a given species
on a Pareto frontier along with any unexpected behavior
at <a href="http://c-mind.org/repo">c-mind.org/repo</a>.

Furthermore, the community can continuously classify solutions, 
prune redundant ones, and correlate them with various features
of software, its inputs (data sets) and used hardware either
manually (similar to Wikipedia) or using available big data 
analytics and machine learning techniques.

<BR>
<BR>

Our approach can also help computer engineering community create 
the first public, realistic, large, diverse, distributed, representative,
and continuously evolving benchmark with related optimization
knowledge while gradually covering all possible software and
hardware to be able to predict best optimizations and improve
compilers depending on usage scenarios and requirements.

Such continuously growing collective knowledge accessible via
simple web service can become an integral part of the practical
software and hardware co-design of self-tuning computer systems 
as we demonstrate in several real usage scenarios validated 
in industry.
