It has been referenced in patents and extended in academia and industry. We utilized Interactive Compilation Interface for PathScale compiler with loop vectorization, tiling, unrolling, interchange, fission/fusion, pipelining, prefetching and array padding to make static binaries adaptable and reactive to various environments and run-time behaviour to improve execution time and power consumption.
