      "note": "I started implementing a plugin framework and a plugin for GCC to transparently tune optimization heuristic and embed special function to collect run-time info about behavior of real programs and data sets in real environments from multiple users. Originally, I connected my framework to MySQL database, but it could not cope with huge amount of data. Therefore, I tried to implement another solution - sharing best optimizations/speedups via P2P networks such as overnet, bittorent and edonkey. Unfortunately, the solution became rather complex and unstable due to a lack of stable and universally acceptable P2P tools. So, I had to move back to MySQL database in the EU FP6 MILEPOST project [$#cm_d76ac3bb9a3f744c_38aa288519b38bf7#$]. However, I later implemented my own P2P sharing mechanism with noSQL Hadoop-based repository in [$#cm_d76ac3bb9a3f744c_be42dc8eef7d2041#$, $#cm_d76ac3bb9a3f744c_bd5c924415bae775#$] while investigating capabilities of new third-party P2P tools."
