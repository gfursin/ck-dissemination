      "note": "My first autotuning experience - at that time, we had removable disks with only 360Kb, and it was extremely challenging to archive files on multiple disks. As a practical solution, I created a tool that checked free space on all disks and size of all files to randomly find the best packing strategy (within amount of time specified by a user). Interestingly, it worked as good as a greedy algorithm but about an order of magnitude faster which was important on very slow computers of that time. This was my first successful autotuning experience that I reused in all my further research."
